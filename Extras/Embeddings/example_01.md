Below are example implementations for D-vector, I-vector, and X-vector using PyTorch. The code demonstrates simplified workflows for understanding the concepts.

1. D-vector (Deep Vector)

The D-vector is typically derived from a deep neural network. Hereâ€™s an example of extracting D-vectors from a DNN trained to classify speakers.

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Example DNN for D-vector
class DVectorModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, num_speakers):
        super(DVectorModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, num_speakers)  # Output layer for speaker classification

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        return x

# Generate D-vectors
def extract_d_vector(model, features):
    with torch.no_grad():
        embeddings = model(features)
    return embeddings

# Example usage
input_dim = 40  # e.g., MFCC features
hidden_dim = 128
num_speakers = 10

model = DVectorModel(input_dim, hidden_dim, num_speakers)
features = torch.rand(1, input_dim)  # Simulated speech feature
d_vector = extract_d_vector(model, features)
print("D-vector:", d_vector)

2. I-vector (Identity Vector)

I-vectors are statistical embeddings, so we use a simpler mock implementation with PyTorch for conceptual understanding. A full implementation requires GMM-UBM training, which is computationally intensive.

import torch

# Simulated I-vector extraction (mock example)
class IVectorExtractor:
    def __init__(self, total_variability_dim):
        self.total_variability_matrix = torch.randn(40, total_variability_dim)  # Example variability matrix

    def extract(self, features):
        # Map features into the total variability space
        i_vector = features @ self.total_variability_matrix
        return i_vector

# Example usage
features = torch.rand(1, 40)  # Simulated MFCC features
extractor = IVectorExtractor(total_variability_dim=20)
i_vector = extractor.extract(features)
print("I-vector:", i_vector)

3. X-vector (Extended Vector)

The X-vector uses a Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) for extracting embeddings. Below is a simplified PyTorch implementation.

import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# TDNN for X-vector extraction
class XVectorModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, embedding_dim):
        super(XVectorModel, self).__init__()
        self.tdnn1 = nn.Conv1d(input_dim, hidden_dim, kernel_size=5, stride=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.tdnn2 = nn.Conv1d(hidden_dim, hidden_dim, kernel_size=3, stride=1)
        self.pool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool1d(1)  # Statistics pooling layer
        self.embedding = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, embedding_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.tdnn1(x))
        x = self.relu(self.tdnn2(x))
        x = self.pool(x).squeeze(-1)  # Pooling across time
        x = self.embedding(x)
        return x

# Example usage
input_dim = 40  # e.g., MFCC features
hidden_dim = 128
embedding_dim = 64

model = XVectorModel(input_dim, hidden_dim, embedding_dim)
features = torch.rand(1, 40, 100)  # Simulated features (batch_size, input_dim, time_frames)
x_vector = model(features)
print("X-vector:", x_vector)

Key Notes

1. D-vector: Extracted from intermediate layers of a neural network trained for speaker classification.


2. I-vector: Requires GMM-UBM training. The example here is simplified for demonstration.


3. X-vector: Uses a TDNN with a statistics pooling layer to create robust speaker embeddings.
