   - It's recommended to use a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. **Install necessary packages**:
   - Depending on the project or tutorial, install required packages using `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt  # If a requirements file is provided
     ```
   - For individual projects, refer to their specific instructions for package installations.

## Usage

- **Explore Tutorials**: Navigate through the directories to find tutorials on Python, PyTorch, and more.

- **Run Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive learning, run the notebooks using Jupyter:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```

- **Execute Python Scripts**: For standalone scripts, execute them directly:
  ```bash
  python script_name.py
  ```

## Technologies Used
